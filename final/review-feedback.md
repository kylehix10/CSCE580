    Q1a:
        comments:
        marks: 2 + 10 + 8 = 20
    Q2:
        comments: Good work but code and data (with changes) were expected to replicated/ verify work. So marks deducted for it.
        marks: 15 + 0 + (10 + 10 + 10 + 10) + 10
    Total: 20 + 65 = 85 (Out of 120, will be scaled later)
