1. AI Translator(ChatGPT) v. Basic Translator (Google Translate).
   Cloud AI Image Generator(DALL-E) v. Local AI (On-device)
   AI Writing Assistant v. Basic Text Editor
   
   a) In all three comparisons the local AI or processor was greatly more efficient than the cloud-based AI models. When toggling with the AI usage, increasing the batch size made the cloud-based AI more efficient, bringing its Wh per unit to less than .5. Similar results occurred when using cloud-based AI from a data center that was closer to the user.
   
  b) Translation: Cloud: 2.9 Wh per query
                  Google Translate: 0.3 Wh per query
      Image Generator: Cloud: 2.9 Wh per Image
                        Local AI: .3 Wh per image
      Writing Assistant: Cloud: 1.5 Wh per session
                          Local: .1 Wh per session
      On average, the GenAI requires 9 times more energy per use than the local options.

iii) Recipe 1)
     PF1: "Convert the following text file into a full R3 file." Result is in code folder
     PF2: "Use the same file and create a full R3 file." 
     PF3: "Using the same file, convert it into a comprehensive R3 file"
     PP-1: "Use the attached file and create an R3 file of only ingredients"
     PP-2: "Repeat the process but make an R3 file with only the instructions"

     Recipe 2)
     PF1: "Use this text file and convert it into an R3 file"
     PF2: "Use the same file and convert it into a full R3 file."
     PF3: "Convert the given file into a full R3 file."
     PP-1: "Use the attached file and create and R3 for only the ingredients."
     PP-2: "Do the same the but for the instructions only"
