This spinach tortellini soup is really simple and tastes even better the next day. I got this recipe from a friend who's in culinary school.

Directions
Combine chicken broth and spinach in a large pot over high heat; bring to a boil.

Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in tortellini; cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, about 3 to 5 minutes. Season with basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
