instructions:
  1. Make the shrimp stock: In a pot, add the shrimp shells, onion, green pepper, garlic, celery, and bay leaves.
     Cover with water, bring to a boil, and simmer for 30–45 minutes. Strain and reserve the liquid.
  2. Make the roux: In a heavy pot, heat oil or lard over medium heat. Add flour and stir constantly until the
     mixture turns a rich peanut-butter color (about 10–15 minutes).
  3. Add the chopped celery, green pepper, jalapeños, onion, and garlic to the roux. Stir and cook for 5 minutes
     until softened.
  4. Slowly add the shrimp stock (or other stock) while stirring to avoid lumps.
  5. Stir in Cajun seasoning, celery seed, paprika, and salt. Simmer uncovered for 10–15 minutes until slightly thickened.
  6. Add the shrimp and cook until they just turn pink (about 3–5 minutes). Do not overcook.
  7. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding hot sauce to preference.
  8. Garnish with green onions and serve over rice.
